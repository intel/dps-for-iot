DPS has two security mechanisms: end-to-end encryption/signing and
link-layer encryption. Publication and acknowledgement messages can be
encrypted/signed end-to-end.  Messages are encrypted/signed using
[COSE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152).

For privacy and to protect the network hop-by-hop links DPS uses link
layer encryption where possible: DTLS for UDP, TLS for TCP, and
transport-specific encryption for over non-IP networks. IP multicast
packets do not use link-layer encryption. Because DPS is fundamentally
a multi-hop mesh protocol payloads are secured end-to-end.

As noted above publications and acknowledgement messages can be
encrypted/signed using COSE. The protection in this case is
end-to-end, the trust relationship is directly between the publishing
node and the subscribing node, and intermediate nodes that simply
route packets over the DPS mesh do not require a trust relationship
with either the publishers or subscribers and do not hold keys. The
publication or acknowledgement data payload is encrypted/signed,
publications also carry the publication topic strings: these are
included in the encrypted/signed payload. Message fields required for
routing messages are integrity checked but obviously cannot be
encrypted.  The sending port number and TTL change on each hop so
cannot be included in the end-to-end integrity check. The COSE format
includes an optional KID (key-identifier) field. Encrypted DPS
messages always have a KID which allows the different publications to
use different encryption keys.

Subscriptions do not carry payload data and the bit vectors carried in
the payloads get recomputed at each hop. Unlike publications and
acknowledgements, subscriptions do not use COSE and rely solely on
encryption at the link-layer.

Even when data is encrypted there are attack vectors based on traffic
analysis. Traffic analysis is harder on a multi-hop mesh but because
publications contain routing information that cannot be encrypted
end-to-end. Specifically an attacker with access to a compromised node
could use a dictionary attack to identify the topic strings in the
publications and subscriptions flowing through that node.  Where this
is a concern the publishing and subscribing end-points can agree on a
shared private encoding of topic strings, for example HMAC with a
shared seed.

The following sections assume you are already familiar with the
@link message-encoding message encoding @endlink.

@section content-encryption Content Encryption
The @em protected section of a DPS message forms the protected
attributes from the application as identified in COSE.  The @em
encrypted section of a DPS message is the plaintext provided to the
content encryption algorithm and is replaced by a COSE object, one of
@em COSE_Encrypt_Tagged, @em COSE_Encrypt0_Tagged, or @em
COSE_Sign1_Tagged.

The implemented content encryption algorithms is @em A256GCM.

@section content-key-distribution Content Key Distribution
The encryption key is determined by the recipient algorithm.  DPS
supports the @em direct, @em A256KW, and <em>ECDH-ES + A256KW</em>
recipient algorithms.

The use of the key wrap variants allows multiple recipients to be
included in a message.

@subsection elliptic-curve-keys Elliptic Curve Keys
DPS supports the <em>NIST P-384 (secp384r1)</em> and <em>NIST P-521
(secp521r1)</em> curves.

Point compression is not supported.  Both the x and y coordinates must
be included in EC key representations such as the ephemeral sender
key.

@subsection key-derivation-functions Key Derivation Functions
HKDF requires context information to be provided.  This is represented
in COSE as the @em COSE_KDF_Context.

The values of the @em identity, @em nonce, and @em other fields of the
@em PartyUInfo and @em PartyVInfo structures in the @em
COSE_KDF_Context are @em nil.

@em SuppPrivInfo is not included in the @em COSE_KDF_Context.

@section counter-signatures Counter Signatures
After encryption, the encrypted content is signed by the sender and
the signature is included as a COSE counter signature.  This allows
intermediate DPS nodes to authenticate the sender of a message without
decrypting the contents of the message.

DPS supports the @em ES384, and @em ES512 signature algorithms.

@section signatures Signatures
Alternatively, the plaintext content may also be signed by the sender
in a @em COSE_Sign1_Tagged message.  The @em protected section of a
DPS message continues to form the protected attributes from the
application as identified in COSE.

DPS supports the @em ES384, and @em ES512 signature algorithms.

@section examples Examples
An example encrypted publication message, using @em A256GCM
for the content, @em ECDH-ES+A256KW for the key distribution, and
@em ES512 for signing, will look like:
